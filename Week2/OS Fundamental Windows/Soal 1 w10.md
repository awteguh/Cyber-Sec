## Windows POWERSHELL Question
In this lab, will be using the POWERSHELL to implement a files and folders structure on your home directory. Creating files and folders along with moving through them are very common operations. The POWERSHELL makes these operations easy and quick to perform as you are able to move directly to specific locations and perform specific operations.

Using the Powershell Command, create the following structure on your home directory. The Square boxes are folders, while the lines represent folders contained inside each one. As can be seen in the diagram below, the structure looks like a hierarchy and this is what the use of folders provides for – a hierarchy of where data should be saved and stored.

Before you start, using any application you like (e.g. Notepad), create three text files: cust1.txt; cust2.txt and cust3.txt and two documents leave.txt and medical.txt. These should be created and saved at the top/root of your home directory.

Now, using the POWERSHELL only, implement the following folder structure. Write down the sequence of commands that allow you to create the structure below:

Now that you have created the directory structure, write the POWERSHELL commands that control it in the following ways (1 – 10).

1. Move the three customer files to the customer directory.

2. Copy the three customer files to the archive directory using a single command

3. Move the file leave.txt to the archive directory and rename it leave_old.txt

4. Place leave_old.txt in the forms directory.

5. Change to the customer directory and check that it contains the three customer files.

6. Change to the archive directory and check it contains the three customer files that you copied.

7. Change back to the customer directory and delete the three customer files.

8. Display the contents of the text files in the command prompt window one at a time. (You may need to use help to find the command do this).

9. Clear the screen

10. Exit the POWERSHELL window
